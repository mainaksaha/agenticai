    "# ReAct Pattern Demonstration\n",

    "This Jupyter notebook demonstrates a **ReAct (Reason + Act) pattern** applied to a simple airline refund scenario. We break the logic into **four sections**:\n",
    "1. **Policy Logic**\n",
    "2. **LLM Adapter**\n",
    "3. **ReAct Agent**\n",
    "4. **Main Orchestration**\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll simulate an airline chatbot that decides whether a passenger is eligible for a refund. The ReAct approach is:\n",
    "- **Reason**: Form an internal chain of thought.\n",
    "- **Act**: Possibly call an external \"tool\" (in this case, the policy logic) to get data.\n",
    "- **Observe**: Incorporate tool results.\n",
    "- **Conclude**: Return a final user-facing answer.\n",
